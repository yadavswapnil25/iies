                  <h3>Fee of No Objection Certificate</h3>
                  <p>This document outlines the No Objection Certificate (NOC) fees established by the Indian International Economic Service (IIES). These fees are designed to cover the administrative costs, document verification, and certification expenses associated with the process. The fee structure not only streamlines the application process but also ensures that applications are treated seriously and dealt with in a timely manner.</p>
                  <p>The IIES issues NOCs and has set specific fees which may vary based on the type of international transaction or the amount of funds involved. According to IIES policies, the organization issues an NOC for a maximum amount of ₹25,000 crores at one time. This means that if an individual or institution requires a certificate for a higher amount, they must obtain the NOC through separate applications or in a phased manner.</p>
                  <p>The NOC fee structure is generally determined by the application amount, the complexity of the process, and the documentation involved. The purpose of this fee is not just to cover administrative costs but also to ensure that applicants comply with the necessary legal and financial standards. The IIES conducts this process with complete transparency and according to standard rules to prevent any kind of fraud or financial irregularity.</p>
                  <p>In summary, the fee set by the IIES for obtaining an NOC is part of an essential administrative process, and the certificate can be issued for a maximum amount of ₹25,000 crores at a time. This limit and fee policy reflect the institution's responsibility for financial control and monitoring international monetary flows.</p>

            <p>
              The NOC fee serves two main purposes: (1) revenue generation for the Central Government, and (2) a compliance filter — collecting evidence of applicant’s ability and knowledge about incoming foreign funds. The requirement to pay a prescribed fee helps deter and detect potential money-laundering, shell transactions, or cases where the applicant is unaware of funds credited to their account.

              <!-- <h4>1. Eligible Persons:</h4> -->
              <ul>
                <li>Automatic Hold / Application Pendency: If the prescribed NOC fee is not deposited within the initial submission window (e.g., 30 calendar days from application), the NOC application will be placed on hold (status: “Fee Pending”) and processing will stop.</li>
                <li>Risk Flag & Preliminary Screening: Any application where the fund amount exceeds a threshold (for example, ₹10 lakh) but the fee remains unpaid will be automatically flagged for enhanced due diligence (EDD). This flag triggers KYC re-verification, source-of-fund documentation requests (contracts, donor details, remittance advices), and a transaction history review.</li>
                <li>Notice to Applicant: A written notice (digital and/or physical) will be sent giving the applicant a final opportunity (e.g., 15 days) to pay the fee and provide missing documents. The notice must clearly state consequences of non-payment, including possible reporting.</li>
                <li>
                 Escalation & Suspicion of ML: If fee remains unpaid and document gaps persist, the case will be escalated to the designated compliance officer and, where warranted, reported to Financial Intelligence Unit — India (FIU-IND) or other competent authority as a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) for possible money-laundering investigation.
                </li>
                <li>Temporary Freeze / Hold on NOC & Recommendation to Bank: IIES may recommend to the relevant bank to temporarily freeze or flag the concerned inward remittance account for further verification, following legal procedures and after consulting legal/advisory team.</li>
             <li>Refusal / Rejection of NOC: After full internal review and if satisfactory explanations/documents are not provided, the NOC may be formally refused. The applicant will be informed of reasons and appeal mechanism (if any).</li>
            <li>Audit Trail & Recordkeeping: All actions, notices and decisions must be recorded in the application management system for audit, compliance and future reference.</li> 
           
          <li>Penalties & Blacklisting (Policy Option): Policy can specify penalties, additional fees or temporary blacklisting of applicants/agents who deliberately avoid fee payment or provide false documentation. Any such measure must comply with applicable laws and provide procedural fairness.</li></ul>

              <h3>Risk Indicators - Signs that may point to Money Laundering (examples)

​</h3>
              <p>The purpose of the NOC is:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                 Sudden, large-scale credit of foreign funds that does not align with the business activities of the concerned individual/company.
                </li>
                <li>
                 Failure to pay the prescribed NOC fee, despite the fund amount being very high.
                </li>
                <li>
                 Applicant failing to provide clear source-of-funds details or not submitting supporting documents.
                </li>
                <li>
                 Unclear identification of the beneficial owner, or the presence of a shell company.
                </li>
                <li>Large-scale funds arriving in the account through many small remittances (structuring).</li>
              <li>The presence of these indicators recommends Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) and mandatory legal reporting.</li>
